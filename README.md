# FizzBuzz
A Full WebPage for the common FizzBuzz interview question

My goal throughout this repository is to make a full page answer to the commonly asked "FizzBuzz" interview question.
For those of you that don't know, this question or task is as follows. 
Write some code to check the following conditions.
1. if the given number is divisible by 3 the code should say "Fizz"
2. if the given number is divisible by 5 the code should say "Buzz"
3. and finally if the given number is divisible by both 3 AND 5 the code should say "FizzBuzz"

I won't so much go over how to answer the question itself, as I will be actually creating a page or GUI to answer the question. 


My main guidlines are as follows:
1. A clean user interface that has a clear purpose
2. answer the given question!
3. be able to change the numbers I want to divide by
4. Have fun while learning!

I'll continue to update this repo as I continue through the task.
